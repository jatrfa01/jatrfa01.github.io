<h1> Hello World, this is mmmmme Fatimetu </h1>
<p> I'm Fatimetu from Western Sahara but I live in Algeria. Three years ago I studied IB in Nordic United World College in Norway and now I study Math and Computer Science here at Luther College.
I speak Arabic, Hassani, Spanish, English, Gallego and French. I speak the first four pretty well and I'm still working on the last two. Learning new languages has always been a part of me.</p>
<p></p>This summer I was doing Davis Project for Peace,I build a big art room for the kids of Valencia school in the Sahrawi refugee campus in Algeria. 
Now, I work both for the math department and the Mail Center here at Luther College. </p>
<p> I'm really intrested in politics and human rights issues and in making a positive impact in the world. I'm also intrested in learning software programing, I LOVE CODING </p>
<p>In my free time I love to socialize, go out with my friends and just laugh. I also love to sleep during my break time</p>During my free time, I like to sleep</p>
