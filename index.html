      <p> I'm Fatimetu Bachir Jatri Emhamed from Western Sahara but I live in Algeria. Three years ago I studied IB (International Baccalaureate) in Red Cross United World College in Norway and now I study Math and Computer Science here at Luther College.
      I speak Arabic, Hassani, Spanish, English, Gallego and French. I speak the first four pretty well and I'm still working on the last two. Learning new languages has always been a part of me.</p>
