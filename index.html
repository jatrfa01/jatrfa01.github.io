<h1> Hello World, this is me Fatimetu </h1>
<p> I'm Fatimeu from Western Sahraw but I live in Algeria. Three years ago I studied IB in Nordic United World College and now I study Math and Computer Science here at Luther College.
I speak Arabic, Hassani, Spanish, English, Gallego and French. I speak the first four pretty well and I am still working on the last two. Learning new languages has always been part of me.
This summer i was busy doing Davis Project for Peace. I build a big art room for the kids of Valencia school in the Sahrawi refugee campus in Algeria. 
Now, I work at Luther Collge both for the math department and in the mail center</p>
